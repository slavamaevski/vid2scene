# vid2scene

Turn a phone video into an interactive 3D Gaussian-Splat scene. Open-source self-hostable version of [vid2scene.com](https://vid2scene.com).

- **Upload a video** → SfM (GLOMAP / VGGT) → 3D Gaussian Splat training (gsplat) → in-browser viewer
- **Web app + GPU worker + persistent storage** in a single `docker compose` stack
- **Apache-2.0** licensed; runs locally with zero external accounts (HuggingFace token only needed for optional gated models)

## Setup guide

A start-to-finish walkthrough from a fresh machine to a running stack. If you already have Docker + NVIDIA GPU support, skip to [step 4](#4-get-the-code).

**Before you start — hardware & OS:**
- **Linux** (native) or **Windows 10/11 + WSL2**. macOS can run the web stack but **not** the GPU `worker` (no NVIDIA GPU), so it isn't a target for actually processing videos.
- An **NVIDIA GPU** with a recent driver (the worker compiles COLMAP / gsplat against CUDA).
- **~30 GB free disk** for the worker image + model caches, plus room for your scenes.

### 1. Install Docker

Install **Docker Engine 24+** with the **Compose plugin** (the `docker compose` subcommand). Use Docker's official docs rather than ad-hoc commands:

- **Linux — Docker Engine:** <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/> (the Compose plugin ships with it; if missing, see <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/>)
- **Linux — post-install** (run Docker without `sudo`): <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/> — add your user to the `docker` group, then log out/in.
- **Windows / macOS — Docker Desktop:** <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/> (bundles Compose). On Windows, use the **WSL2 backend** and run the project from inside your WSL distro.

Verify:

```bash
docker --version            # 24.x or newer
docker compose version      # v2.x
docker run --rm hello-world # confirms the daemon works
```

### 2. NVIDIA GPU in Docker

The `worker` needs the GPU exposed to containers. You need a working host driver **plus** the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

**Confirm the host driver works first** (this must already pass):

```bash
nvidia-smi        # should print your GPU(s)
```

**Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit** via NVIDIA's official, distro-by-distro instructions:

- **Install guide:** <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html>
- **Configure Docker** (run after install): <https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker> — i.e. `sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker && sudo systemctl restart docker`.

> **Already have the toolkit?** If `docker info --format '{{.Runtimes}}'` lists `nvidia` — or your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` already has an `nvidia` entry under `"runtimes"` — it's installed and registered, so you can skip straight to verifying.

**Verify Docker can see the GPU:**

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi
```

If that prints the GPU table, the worker will too. The compose `worker` service already requests the GPU (`runtime: nvidia` + `deploy.resources.reservations.devices`), so no per-run `--gpus` flag is needed.

**WSL2:** install the NVIDIA driver on **Windows** (the normal Game Ready / Studio driver) — *not* inside the Linux distro. CUDA is passed through to WSL automatically, but you still install `nvidia-container-toolkit` **inside** the WSL distro per the guide above. Make sure `nvidia-smi` works inside WSL before continuing.

### 3. Host networking

Every service in the compose file uses `network_mode: host`. The browser uploads/downloads blobs directly to Azurite at `127.0.0.1:10000`, while web and worker reach postgres/redis/Azurite at `127.0.0.1` server-side — host networking keeps that address identical on every side, so the SAS URLs the server mints work unchanged in the browser.

- **Native Linux Docker** — host networking is built in; nothing to do.
- **Docker Desktop (Windows + WSL2, or macOS)** — host networking is off by default. Enable **Settings → Resources → Network → "Enable host networking"**, then **Apply & restart**.

### 4. Get the code

Clone the repo and initialize the vendored submodules (glomap, gsplat, etc. — required for the worker build):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelm2/vid2scene.git
cd vid2scene
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 5. Configure (optional)

All settings have working defaults. Copy the example env only if you want to change something (admin password, contact email, HF token, etc.):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

See [Configuration](#configuration) for the available variables.

### 6. Build and run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The first build takes a while (the GPU worker image compiles COLMAP / gsplat from source). When it finishes, open <http://localhost:8000> and log in with the default `admin` / `admin`. Upload a video at `/upload/`, wait for the worker to process it, then view the result in the embedded viewer.

The five services — web, worker, redis, postgres, azurite — share host networking so SAS URLs work uniformly for browser, web, and worker. Data persists in named volumes across `up`/`down`; only `docker compose down -v` wipes it. Add `-d` to run detached.

| Service | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `web` | [`Web_Dockerfile`](Web_Dockerfile) (`python:3.11-slim` + `gunicorn`, frontend built in a Node stage) | Django app, REST API, splat viewer, job enqueue |
| `worker` | [`Worker_Dockerfile`](Worker_Dockerfile) (PyTorch + CUDA + COLMAP/glomap/gsplat from source) | The actual ML pipeline: frame extraction, SfM, splat training, LOD/SPZ/SOG export |
| `redis` | `redis:7` | RQ job queue + Django cache |
| `postgres` | `postgres:16` | All app state (users, jobs, scenes) |
| `azurite` | `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite` | Blob storage emulator; the browser uploads/downloads here directly via SAS URLs |

The pipeline lives in [`vid2scene_core/`](vid2scene_core/) and is orchestrated by the worker. SfM defaults to GLOMAP (no model weights needed). VGGT and SAM3-based panorama background removal are opt-in and require a Hugging Face token (see below).

---

## Configuration

Every knob lives in [`.env`](.env.example). All have working defaults; copy and edit what you care about:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | dev-only insecure | Fine as-is for local use. **Set your own if you deploy this anywhere others can reach.** |
| `BILLING_ENABLED` | `false` | When off, the Stripe subscription system is hidden and every user gets full access. Turn on (+ set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in the container env) to use the included billing flow. |
| `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_*` | `admin` / `admin` | Bootstrap admin user created on first start. |
| `POSTGRES_*` | `vid2scene` | Database name / user / password for the bundled postgres. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | empty | Only needed for the optional VGGT and SAM3 paths (see below). |
| `RQ_QUEUES` | `internal enterprise high default` | Which RQ queues the worker consumes. |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | `contact@example.com` | Email shown in the UI/footer/docs. |
| `SITE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Canonical URL used in API examples, emails, SEO. |
| `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` | empty | Optional Umami analytics. Empty = no tracker is rendered. |
| `LANDING_VIDEO_BASE_URL` | empty | Optional CDN base for the landing-page hero video. Empty = poster only. |

## Django admin

Django (the web framework powering the backend) comes with a powerful built-in admin website for viewing, configuring, and orchestrating the vid2scene platform. It lives at `/admin/`; log in with the superuser account (`admin` / `admin` unless you changed `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_*`). From there you can search, edit, and delete any record — scenes, users, jobs, and so on.

This project also adds custom tooling on top of it for running the site:

- **Scenes** — curate which ones appear on the examples page and re-run processing on selected jobs.
- **Site alerts** — post site-wide banner notifications.
- **API keys** — issue and inspect per-user API keys.
- **Billing** — review subscriptions, credits, and refunds (only relevant with `BILLING_ENABLED=true`).

There are a lot of cool features. Definitely try it out!

---

## Optional ML model paths (HuggingFace)

The default `reconstruction_method=glomap` uses pure C++ SfM and needs **no model weights, no HF account, no token**. Two paths download gated models from HuggingFace and require some one-time setup:

1. **VGGT** (faster but heavier SfM, picked via `reconstruction_method=vggt`) — uses `facebook/VGGT-1B-Commercial`.
2. **Equirectangular / 360° background removal** — uses `facebook/sam3`.

To enable either:
1. Create an account at <https://huggingface.co>.
2. Visit each repo's page and click **"agree to license"**.
3. Generate a [user access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and put it in `.env`:
   ```
   HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
   ```

Downloads are cached in the `hf-cache` named volume, so models persist across `docker compose down`/`up` and only download once.

---

## Development

For frontend or backend work without rebuilding the full Docker stack:

```bash
# Backend (Python)
cd vid2scene_server
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ENVIRONMENT=development python manage.py runserver

# Frontend (Svelte/Vite)
cd vid2scene_server/viewer
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server with HMR
# (or `npm run build` to produce the static manifest)
```

In bare-metal dev mode the stack falls back to **sqlite + local redis (127.0.0.1:6379) + local Azurite (127.0.0.1:10000) + console email**. Spin up redis and Azurite separately on those ports.

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd vid2scene_server
python manage.py test
```

The billing-dependent tests pin `BILLING_ENABLED=True` via `@override_settings`, so they pass in either configuration.

## Security

This is the **self-host build**, meant to run on a single trusted machine. It runs Django in development mode (`DEBUG` on, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` limited to localhost) and ships with insecure defaults — `admin` / `admin`, a dev `SECRET_KEY`, default database credentials, much of the backend privacy functionality removed, and a localhost-only blob store with permissive CORS.

The production deployment used by the hosted service has been **stripped from this release**: the CI/CD pipeline, real secrets and API keys, hosted-service email/legal content, and similar security code are not included. The hardened `ENVIRONMENT=production` settings (DEBUG off, security headers, real Azure/SendGrid wiring) remain in [`settings.py`](vid2scene_server/vid2scene_server/settings.py) for reference only.
